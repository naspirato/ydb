# Requirements for YDB Analytics System

## Introduction
This document outlines the detailed functional and non-functional requirements for the YDB analytics system, including associated test cases for verification.

## Non-functional Requirements

### Performance

- **REQ-PERF-001**: Ensure system operations meet expected performance benchmarks.
  - **Description**: Maintain performance standards across operations, ensuring response times and throughput align with requirements.
  - **Cases**:
    - Case 7.1: [Bulk Upsert Performance](path/to/test/34) - Measure and analyze the efficiency of bulk upsert operations.
    - Case 7.2: [DELETE Operation Speed](path/to/test/35) - Validate performance expectations during DELETE operations.
    - Case 7.3: [TTL Deletion Speed](path/to/test/36) - Measure and confirm deletion speed exceeds insertion speed.

### Disk Space Management
- **REQ-DISK-001**: Effectively manage disk space to avoid system failures.
  - **Description**: Utilize efficient disk space management strategies, particularly under scenarios with constrained disk resources.
  - **Cases**:
    - Case 8.1: [Disk Space Recovery](path/to/test/37) - Test system behavior and recovery strategies for low disk space conditions.
    - Case 8.2: [Resilience to Disk Saturation](path/to/test/38) - Ensure database resilience and behavior expectations under full disk conditions.

### Documentation
- **REQ-DOC-001**: Maintain and update comprehensive documentation.
  - **Description**: Ensure all functionalities are clearly documented, aiding user orientation and system understanding.
  - **Cases**:
    - Case 9.1: [Documentation Completeness](path/to/test/39) - Review documentation for completeness and clarity.

## Federated Queries Support

- **REQ-FEDQ-001**: Allow and manage federated query execution.
  - **Description**: Enable and validate operations involving federated query execution, taking advantage of diverse data sources.
  - **Cases**:
    - Case 10.1: [Cross-Source Federated Queries](path/to/test/40) - Test execution of queries spanning multiple federated data sources.
    - Case 10.2: [Federated Source Data Insertions](path/to/test/41) - Validate data insertions deriving from federated sources.
