### Import/Export via CLI

- **REQ-DS-001**: Import/Export via CLI
  - **Functionality**: Implement and document CLI commands for importing and exporting data from/to datashards.
  - **Description**: Provide robust CLI tools to facilitate data operations for users managing datashards.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Successful execution of `ydb import` and `ydb export` commands.
    - Verification of data integrity post-import and post-export.
    - Documentation includes examples of usage.
    - Integration testing with various data formats (JSON, CSV, Parquet).
  - **Cases**:
    - Case 1.1: [Import from CSV - 1GB](path/to/test/import_csv_1gb) - Validate import from CSV file.
    - Case 1.2: [Export to JSON - 10GB](path/to/test/export_json_10gb) - Validate export to JSON data.
    - Case 1.3: [Import from Parquet - 100GB](path/to/test/import_parquet_100gb) - Validate import from Parquet file.
    - Case 1.4: [Export to CSV - 1TB](path/to/test/export_csv_1tb) - Validate export to CSV data.

### Performance 

- **REQ-DS-002**: Performance Testing of Import/Export Operations
  - **Functionality**: Conduct performance tests to evaluate the efficiency of import/export CLI operations.
  - **Description**: Measure and document performance metrics for import/export operations to ensure scalability and efficiency.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Test scenarios covering various data sizes and import/export patterns.
    - Performance metrics (throughput, latency, errors) measured and documented.
    - Recommendations for optimal settings based on test results.
  - **Cases**:
    - Case 2.1: [Import Performance - 1GB](path/to/test/import_performance_1gb) - Measure import speed with 1GB of data.
    - Case 2.2: [Export Performance - 10GB](path/to/test/export_performance_10gb) - Measure export speed with 10GB of data.
    - Case 2.3: [Import Performance - 100GB](path/to/test/import_performance_100gb) - Measure import speed with 100GB of data.
    - Case 2.4: [Export Performance - 1TB](path/to/test/export_performance_1tb) - Measure export speed with 1TB of data.

- **REQ-DS-003**: Performance Testing of Datashard Operations
  - **Functionality**: Conduct performance tests to evaluate the efficiency of datashard operations (split, merge, etc.).
  - **Description**: Ensure that operations such as splitting and merging datashards perform efficiently under various conditions.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Test scenarios covering various load conditions and datashard configurations.
    - Key performance metrics (e.g., throughput, latency, success rate of shard operations) are measured and documented.
    - Recommendations for best practices to optimize datashard operations.
  - **Cases**:
    - Case 3.1: [Split Performance - Moderate Load](path/to/test/split_performance_moderate_load) - Measure performance of split operations under moderate load.
    - Case 3.2: [Merge Performance - Heavy Load](path/to/test/merge_performance_heavy_load) - Measure performance of merge operations under heavy load.
    - Case 3.3: [Split/Merge Performance - Mixed Workload](path/to/test/split_merge_performance_mixed_workload) - Measure performance of split and merge operations under mixed workload conditions.
    - Case 3.4: [Split/Merge Stability - Large Datasets](path/to/test/split_merge_stability_large_datasets) - Ensure stability of split and merge operations with large datasets.
